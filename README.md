## Employee Attrition Analysis: Insights with HR Analytics & R ##

Project Duration: February 2024 - May 2024
Institution: College of Information Studies (UMD iSchool), University of Maryland

## Project Overview ##
This project analyzes employee attrition patterns using Logistic Regression and Random Forest models to derive insights that can improve employee retention strategies. The dataset consists of 15,000 observations and 10 features, sourced from Kaggle's HR Analytics dataset.

## Key Objectives ##
	• Identify key factors that contribute to employee turnover.
	• Predict employee attrition with high accuracy using machine learning algorithms.
	• Provide data-driven recommendations to enhance employee retention strategies.


## Methodology ##
	• Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies to ensure data quality.
	• Exploratory Data Analysis: Performed correlation analysis to identify significant relationships between variables like satisfaction level, project count, monthly hours, and salary with employee attrition.
	• Hypothesis Testing: Conducted a one-sample t-test to assess the difference in satisfaction levels between employees who stayed and those who left.
	• Modeling: Applied Logistic Regression and Random Forest to predict employee turnover. Achieved 97.84% accuracy using Random Forest, with satisfaction level and monthly hours as top predictors.
	• Visualization: Visualized key trends in employee satisfaction, evaluation, salary, and workload using plots to highlight factors affecting turnover.

## Results ##
	• Key Predictors of Attrition: Satisfaction level and monthly hours were identified as the most influential factors in employee turnover.
	• Model Accuracy: Achieved a 97.84% prediction accuracy using Random Forest.
	• HR Insights: Provided actionable insights for data-driven HR decisions, aimed at improving employee retention strategies.
